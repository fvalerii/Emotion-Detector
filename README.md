# Project Overview

This project showcases a comprehensive full-stack application for analyzing customer feedback. Developed as part of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate, it demonstrates a complete workflow from AI model integration to web deployment. The core of this application is an emotion detection system built using IBM Watson's natural language processing (NLP) libraries. It goes beyond traditional sentiment analysis by identifying specific emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and more, from text-based customer reviews.

This solution is ideal for e-commerce companies seeking to gain deeper insights into their customer base, enabling them to build more sophisticated recommendation systems, refine product strategies, and enhance automated customer support chatbots.

## Key Features

 * Emotion Detection: Utilizes the robust IBM Watson NLP library to accurately identify a range of human emotions from free-form text.
 
 * Web Application Deployment: Deploys the AI model as a scalable and user-friendly web application using the Flask framework.
 
 * Robust Error Handling: Implements comprehensive error handling to ensure application stability and a seamless user experience.
 
 * Unit Testing: Includes a suite of unit tests to validate application functionality and ensure code reliability.
 
 * Static Code Analysis: Integrates static code analysis to maintain high code quality standards.
 
 * Full-Stack Development: Demonstrates proficiency in both back-end logic (Python, Flask) and front-end presentation.
